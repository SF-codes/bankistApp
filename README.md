A simplistic bank app that allows you to login, transfer funds from your own account to another user, request a loan, etc

This simple bank app was very fun to make!
It features login function capabilities, transfer of funds from one user to another (Which you can see!), request a loan with a wait time until acceptance (Not like real life wait time, I promise!), withdraw and deposit $

Technologies used: JavaScript

With heavy DOM manipulation, data transformations, method chaining and date management
